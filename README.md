Variable	Value
nums	[2,7,11,15]
target	9
index	[0,1]


##Question 1 : Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.


Restate: Find and return the indexes of the elements in an array that add up to a specific target.

Assumptions: You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example Input: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,



##Question 2: Given two arrays of integers nums and index. Your task is to create target array under the following rules:
* Initially target array is empty.
* From left to right read nums[i] and index[i], insert at index index[i] the value nums[i] in target array.
* Repeat the previous step until there are no elements to read in nums and index.
Return the target array.

Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]

Variable	Value
nums	[0,1,2,3,4]
ind	Index value
